#### 1-3.Electromagnetic Spectrum and the 5G frequencies
The electromagnetic spectrum refers to the frequencies and wavelengths that encompass electromagnetic radiation, which is the flow of energy at the speed of light through free space or a vacuum in the form of electric or magnetic fields. Some good examples of electromagnetic radiation include radio waves, gamma rays, visible light and also 5g radiation. Characteristic of these waves are their frequency and intensity and each has it’s own identifiable pattern. Encompassing all of these variations, the electromagnetic spectrum is made up of several subranges, more commonly known as portions. Each portion represents a different set of characteristics and behaviors based on the emission, transmission, absorption, and application of the various waves.

#### 1-3.Frequency and Wavelength of 5G and electromagnetic spectrum

Frequency is defined as the number of times a wave passes a particular point within a unit of time. Wavelength on the other hand is characterized by the distance between two corresponding points of two waves. Both of these measurements play a part in determining where a particular type of energy or wave falls on the electromagnetic spectrum. For example, radio waves are less intense an are on the low frequency end of the spectrum with long wavelengths, while gamma rays are more intense with high frequencies and shorter wavelengths. Visible light falls on the middle of this scale and is responsible for making it possible for things to be seen by the human eye. Between the microwaves and the terahertz waves creates a significant heat effect. Coincidentally, 5G radiation (see the red bar) falls directly in this radiation area.

### 2.무선통신에 왜 전자기파(Radio Waves)를 이용하는것일까?
#### 2-1.전자기파는 매질이 필요가 없기 때문에 공간상에 마음껏 뿌려질 수 있다는 것 이다. 
#### 2-2.빛의 속도로 이동하기 때문(관측가능한 범위내에서 가장 빠른 속도로 이동하기 때문이다.)
